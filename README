Abstract
--------
This is mostly based on BootloadHID code. 
Hazardous code inside, many things are REALLY ugly hacks.
Sorry for that, I've been in a hurry.  

Installation
------------
Slackware style: 
   make && sudo make install

For debian/ubuntu:
   make deb

For Arch Linux you can grab it from aur:
   yaourt -S uisp-userspace

Known Bugs
----------
Windows version is totally broken, until I have time to 
get myself a windows PC and do it properly. You're free to send 
patches.
